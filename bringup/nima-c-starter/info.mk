# External libraries
# LIBS are the compile flags for the libraries
# LIBLIST are the names of targets for the libraries (i.e. util/mk/curl.mk --> curl)
# LIB_VERSION is the version corresponding to each lib, used for util/mk/curl.mk but varies by lib
#
# e.g. LIBS			= -lcurl
# 	   LIBLIST		= curl
#	   CURL_VERSION = 7.28.0
